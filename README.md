# Image binarization

Insert an image and convert it into black-white equivalent, for more details please read the description on the page.

I mainly created this page to use it for printing document papers where the background isn't perfectly white, in which case the printer will print that background and the text on top of it making the printed document unreadable. 

To circumvent this I tried using some photo editing apps on which the best solution was to turn the image into grayscale but that doesn't solve the problem entirely, there probably is a website that does exactly this but it didn't pop up on Page 1 on Google for me so here I am. 

Being unsatisfied with what I found online I decided to fix it myself having prior knowledge of this image processing method. Anyway if you're having the same issue with printing as I was, feel free to try this method and see the results, I was quite happy with it.
